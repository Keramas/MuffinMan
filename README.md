FFXI Sortie 9-boss metric tracking add-on that generates an easy to copy/paste report of the following:

- Party composition for the run
- Aminon battle parse with weaponskill averages (leverages Scoreboard output)
- Tally of total gallimaufry obtained during the run
- Aminon battle duration

For statics that are looking to improve and track metrics over time, this add-on cuts down on the time for filtering and screenshotting scoreboard data, organizes the data in a cleaner formatted table, and easily tallies Gallimaufry without the need for doing manual maths based on your existing total.

Todo:

- Add functionality for sending data to Discord channel via webhook
- Track mini-NMs and other objectives 
- Collect COR roll data for Aminon
